TranslationStateManager - Overwrite-Draft Translation with Sliding Window

Simplified logic:
1. Committed sources are stable - we track the source sentences.
2. Committed translation is the translation of all committed sources (one string).
3. Draft is everything after committed - fully re-translated on every update.
4. When draft accumulates enough SOURCE sentences, promote them to committed.
